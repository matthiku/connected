# connected

## The Problem
You have a group of people with some common interest or a wider family who want to stay connected so 
they use various tools to do just that - Facebook, Whatsapp, Hangouts, Skype, Doodle and what else - all nice tools but they 
all have at least 2 major problems:
1. Various privacy and data protection concerns
2. If you want to participate you're "forced" to sign up to each one

## The Solution
**Connected** helps a **group of friends** or **members of a family** stay connected without having to rely on proprietary 
tools and apps which are either not free or full of advertising and most importantly, collect extensive information about their users.

**Connected** keeps ownership of the data and communication within the group and also gives you control over your privacy 
and data protection matters. 

The only "caveat" is that one person in the group must own some **webspace** somewhere. As all data is encrypted not only 
during transport but also when stored, the only risk remaining is that data in the webspace gets lost or passwords hacked or leaked.
The first can be avoided by regular backups, the second possibly not.
