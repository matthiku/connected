# connected
**Connected** helps a **group of friends** or **members of a family** stay connected without having to rely on proprietary 
tools which are either not free or full of advertising and most importantly, collect information about their users.

Connected keeps ownership of the data and communication within the group and also guarantees privacy and data protection.

The only "caveat" is that one person in the group must own some webspace somewhere. As all data is encrypted not only 
during transport but also when stored, so the only risk remaining is that the webspace gets lost or a password leaked.
The first can be avoided by regular backups, the second by enforcing strong passwords.
